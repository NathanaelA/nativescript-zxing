## Installation 

Run `tns plugin add nativescript-zxing` in your ROOT directory of your project.


## Usage

### Creating a Barcode
```js
var ZXing = require('nativescript-zxing');

var zx = new ZXing();
var img = zx.createBarcode({encode: "Text", height: 100, width: 100, format: ZXing.QR_CODE});

// Do something with the image
```
This creates a barcode image of 100x100 with the "Text" encoded into the QR Code barcode type.
On iOS this will return a UImage which can be assigned to a NativeScript Image; on Android it will return a Bitmap which also can be assigned to a Image. (See Demo)


### Decoding a Barcode
```js
var ZXing = require('nativescript-zxing');
var zx = new ZXing();

// Options are TOTALLY optional
var options = {tryHarder: true, formats: [ZXing.QR_CODE, ZXing.ITF]};

var results = zx.decodeBarcode(source, options);
if (!results) {
    console.log("Unable to decode barcode");
} else {
    console.log("Barcode format", results.format);
    console.log("Barcode value", results.barcode);
}

```
Please note:
* The Options are totally optional, if you don't pass in any options it will attempt to decode all known barcode formats.
If you do pass in the valid formats; the iOS side actually will ONLY use the formats specified; the Android side will still do some auto-detection.
* The tryHarder option will cause the decoding to use a more CPU intensive routine; which **might** find more barcodes.
* The formats; is just a simple array of any of the supported barcode types listed below.

The source image for Android must be a bitmap; the source image for iOS must be a CGImage. (See Demo)
 
 
## Demo
 
 Please see the demo source [http://github.com/NathanaelA/nativescript-zxing/tree/master/demo](http://github.com/NathanaelA/nativescript-zxing/tree/master/demo) for how to read, write and convert between image formats.
 In addition when you SAVE on Android it might take a few minutes before the media indexer will actually see the new image to put it in the image picker.
